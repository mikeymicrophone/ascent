# Ascent
## Approval Voting with Expressive Ballot Control

Election Reform is a popular topic, but one that is complex and difficult to test.  This Rails application, Ascent, is designed to make many types of experiments possible.

### Ascend: Multi-Vote Elections (with conditional votes)

Some people believe that the spoiler effect is basically dominating every aspect of our election system.  By removing the spoiler effect, we might have a less dramatic process, and it might lead to a better government.

The primary goal of this project is therefore to familiarize voters with the possibilities created by a multi-vote approach.

### The Scent: Simulating Complex Preferences

When voters have access to multiple votes, and multiple candidates, you can start to see a lot of detail about their preferences.  The candidates can see those preferences, and factor them into a sophisticated approach of the role they can play.

If we can use the Ascent system to simulate how many groups of voters with different preferences can combine to create a result, it may be useful.

### Assent: Coherence in Policy Conceptualization

Since we give voters a way to opine about specific policy proposals, it is a nudge towards emphasizing the powers that each particular office is truly responsible for.  Perhaps, not every municipal public servant will need to weigh in on the latest "culture war".

A pretty interesting side benefit would be if we established a decent way for citizens to understand what is legal for them, as well as what services they can access.
