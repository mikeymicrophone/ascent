# A voter saying where they live, or used to live: a town (or the county, outside any town) and the
# areas it sits in, with dates for a past residence. The areas are its county, which a city spanning
# several can't settle alone, and its House, state senate and state assembly districts.
#
# A location is used once, never kept: it finds the smallest town and the county and district of each
# chamber whose boundaries cover it. A street address becomes a location through the Census geocoder
# and is dropped as soon as it has one. A searched town fills in each area it lies wholly inside; where the
# town is split, the voter picks from the areas it overlaps, or from the state's when no boundaries are
# mapped.
