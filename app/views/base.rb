class Views::Base < Components::Base
  # The `Views::Base` is an abstract class for all your views.

  # By default, it inherits from `Components::Base`, but you
  # can change that to `Phlex::HTML` if you want to keep views and
  # components independent.
  
  # All Rails view helpers are already included via Components::Base
  # Additional view-specific helpers can be included here if needed
