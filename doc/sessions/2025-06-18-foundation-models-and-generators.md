# Development Session: Foundation Models & Generator Enhancement
**Date:** June 18, 2025  
**Focus:** Election foundation models architecture and custom generator planning

## Session Overview

This session established the foundational architecture for the Ascent approval voting platform and planned enhancements to the existing generator system.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. CLAUDE.md Creation
- Created comprehensive guidance file for future Claude Code instances
- Documented development commands, architecture patterns, and coding conventions
- Emphasized the importance of referencing the detailed convention docs in `doc/llm-assistant/conventions/`
- Highlighted the unique Phlex + semantic Tailwind CSS approach

### 2. Election Foundation Models Architecture
**Goal:** Design the core hierarchical models for elections across different jurisdictions.

**Models Designed:**
- **Jurisdiction Models** (polymorphic approach instead of STI):
  - Country, State, City, Town, Organization as separate models
  - Hierarchical relationships (State → Country, City → State)
- **Position** - Common political roles (Mayor, Governor, President)
- **Office** - Links Position to any Jurisdiction (polymorphic association)
- **Year** - Election years with metadata (even-year, presidential flags)
- **Election** - Links Office to Year (supports mock/historical elections)
- **Person** - Individuals (candidates and voters)
- **Candidacy** - Links Person to Election

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- Used polymorphic associations instead of STI for cleaner jurisdiction handling
- Enabled flexible Office model that can reference any jurisdiction type
- Support for mock elections (education) and historical simulations (research)
- Clear hierarchical flow: Jurisdictions → Positions → Offices → Elections → Candidacies

### 3. Generator Enhancement Planning
**Discovery:** Found existing `PhlexScaffoldGenerator` with solid foundation
- Already generates Phlex views with proper local variable usage
- Creates form/partial components with Tailwind styling
- Handles controller generation with correct conventions

**Planned Enhancements:**
- **Testing Integration:** RSpec specs, FactoryBot factories with political data
- **Convention Alignment:** Service objects, view helpers, enhanced error handling
- **CSS Improvements:** Semantic classes with @apply directives
- **Documentation:** Inline docs, README updates, election-specific options

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `CLAUDE.md` - Comprehensive guidance for future Claude instances
- `doc/llm-assistant/project-context/architecture.md` - Foundation models documentation
- `doc/sessions/2025-06-18-foundation-models-and-generators.md` - This session recap

### Modified Files
- Enhanced `doc/llm-assistant/project-context/architecture.md` with generator planning

## Architecture Insights

### Polymorphic Jurisdiction Design
The decision to use separate models with polymorphic associations rather than STI provides:
- Type-specific behavior and validations
- Clear hierarchical relationships without schema bloat
- Flexibility for new jurisdiction types
- Avoidance of STI complexity and null field issues

### Generator System Value
The existing `PhlexScaffoldGenerator` already handles:
- Proper Phlex view structure with namespacing
- Local variables in controllers (not instance variables)
- Component organization (UI components vs form components)
- Tailwind integration

## Next Steps

1. **Model Implementation:** Generate the foundation models with migrations, validations, and relationships
2. **Factory Creation:** Build FactoryBot factories with descriptive political data for documentation
3. **Generator Enhancement:** Extend the existing generator with testing, CSS, and documentation features
4. **Seed Data:** Create realistic jurisdiction and position seed data for development

## Technical Notes

- Project uses Rails 8.0+ with Phlex instead of ERB
- Four-layer CSS architecture with semantic classnames
- RSpec with FactoryBot for testing, emphasizing descriptive data
- PostgreSQL with multiple databases (main, jobs, caching, ActionCable)
- Comprehensive coding conventions documented in `doc/llm-assistant/conventions/`

## Session Reflection

This session established a solid foundation for the election system architecture while respecting the existing generator infrastructure. The polymorphic jurisdiction approach provides flexibility for the diverse election types outlined in the PRD (mock, historical, organizational), and the generator enhancement plan will accelerate future development while maintaining code quality standards.

The emphasis on descriptive factory data aligns with the project's goal of serving as documentation for political scientists and open-source developers curious about the approval voting system.
