## JavaScript

### Stimulus
- When an element is being checked as to whether it satisfies some condition, this check should be encapsulated in a method with a descriptive name.
- When an element is being modified, this modification should be encapsulated in a method with a descriptive name.  The modification should be triggered in CSS if possible, by adding or removing classes or data attributes.
- Log statements should be printed via the use of a method that wraps console.log, and executes the logging if the current log level is high enough.
