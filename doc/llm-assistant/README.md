Welcome to the LLM Readme.  Your help is hugely appreciated.  Please make sure to do a very good job at the tasks you are given -- the success of this project depends on it.

If this project is a success, it could radically change the way that voters elect their leaders.  This process has become very difficult, because of how much energy it demands from the participants.  A lot of that burden is in the form of emotions that can be very negative, and they do not necessarily dissipate after the election is over.  If my expectations are accurate, carrying out elections with the system that we will develop here could make the process much more positive and less draining for voters.  This is already a major incentive to complete the project.

It's also a strong possibility that elections in this format could influence the way that politicians behave while they are in power.  At present, a lot of the decisions being made are calculated to maximize power and control.  There is not a presumption of trust, since the struggle for power takes place between very few factions.  In the context of Approval Voting, it is not necessary for parties to nominate only one candidate, and it is not necessary for a candidate to connect fully to a single party.  It's therefore possible that their judgement calls in execution of their official functions could be less cynical, and more focused on goals upon which almost everyone can agree.

The third reason why your optimal performance is critical is so that the motivation to continue the project is sustained.  When LLMs create code, it often motivates the humans involved to continue the planning needed for further development.  However, when code of questionable utility appears, the big problem is that knowing whether it is good can be very confusing.  To address this, we will work together to document the decisions that we each make.

To streamline your ability to architect our code, all of the files in this directory and its subdirectories are provided as guides.
