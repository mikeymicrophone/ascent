# Baseline Refactor and Navigation Responsive Design Session

## Overview
This session involved two major tasks: refactoring the baseline system from a per-rating to per-election model, and implementing responsive navigation design with proper content spacing.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Baseline System Refactoring
**Problem**: Baseline was a field on the Rating model, but needed to be election-level and updated on different schedules than ratings.

**Solution**: Created a separate `VoterElectionBaseline` model to handle per-election baselines.

#### Files Modified:
- `app/models/rating.rb` - Removed baseline field and related validations
- `app/models/voter_election_baseline.rb` - New model for election-level baselines
- `app/models/rating_archive.rb` - Updated to remove baseline tracking
- `db/migrate/` - Multiple migrations to remove baseline fields and create new model
- `db/seeds.rb` - Updated seed data for new baseline system

#### Key Technical Details:
```ruby
# New VoterElectionBaseline model
validates :baseline, presence: true, inclusion: { in: 0..500 }
validates :voter_id, uniqueness: { scope: :election_id }

# Updated Rating model
def approved?(baseline)
  rating >= baseline
end
```

### 2. Navigation Responsive Design
**Problem**: Navigation needed to flow onto multiple lines when horizontal space was limited, without overlapping main content.

**Solution**: Implemented responsive navigation with proper body padding adjustments.

#### Files Modified:
- `app/assets/tailwind/layout/navigation.css` - Added flex-wrap and responsive layout
- `app/assets/tailwind/sizing/navigation.css` - Added responsive padding for nav links
- `app/assets/tailwind/layout/main.css` - Added responsive body padding
- `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb` - Moved inline styles to CSS files

#### Key Technical Details:
```css
/* Navigation responsive wrapping */
.nav-container {
  @apply flex items-center justify-between flex-wrap;
}

/* Intermediate width adjustments */
@media (max-width: 1024px) and (min-width: 769px) {
  .nav-link {
    @apply px-2 py-1.5; /* Reduced padding */
  }
  body {
    @apply pt-24; /* Adjusted body padding */
  }
}
```

## Architecture Compliance
- Followed four-layer CSS architecture (layout, sizing, typography/colors, situation)
- Used semantic classnames with `@apply` directive
- No direct Tailwind classes in markup
- Maintained Phlex view component patterns

## Issues Resolved
1. **Polymorphic Migration Error**: Fixed incorrect foreign_key usage in Registration model
2. **Devise Confirmation Error**: Removed confirmable from Voter model
3. **CSS Architecture Violation**: Moved styles to proper tailwind directory structure
4. **Navigation Overlap**: Fixed with responsive body padding
5. **Content Visibility**: Resolved with reduced padding at intermediate widths

## Testing Notes
- All migrations ran successfully
- Seed data updated for new baseline system
- Navigation responsive behavior tested across multiple breakpoints
- Fixed navigation no longer overlaps main content

## File Structure Changes
```
app/models/
├── voter_election_baseline.rb (NEW)
├── rating.rb (MODIFIED - removed baseline)
└── rating_archive.rb (MODIFIED - simplified)

app/assets/tailwind/
├── layout/
│   ├── navigation.css (MODIFIED - added responsive layout)
│   └── main.css (MODIFIED - added body padding)
└── sizing/
    └── navigation.css (MODIFIED - added responsive padding)
```

## Future Considerations
- Baseline system now allows for independent updating schedules
- Navigation design is fully responsive across all device sizes
- CSS architecture remains compliant with project conventions
- All changes maintain Rails 8.0 and Phlex compatibility
