# Session: Scopes Refactoring & Governance System Implementation
**Date**: June 21, 2025
**Duration**: Extended session
**Focus**: ActiveRecord scopes refactoring, Phlex method improvements, and governance system foundation

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. ActiveRecord Scopes Refactoring

**Problem Identified**: Repetitive `#include` and `#where` patterns throughout controllers and models needed consolidation into reusable scopes.

**Analysis Completed**: Comprehensive search found repetitive query patterns across:
- Election model: Complex nested includes for candidacies, office context
- Office model: Elections with candidates associations  
- Voter model: Complex voting activity includes with ratings and baselines
- Person model: Candidacy history with election context
- Geographic models: Election statistics calculations
- Rating/Candidacy models: Election context joins

**Scopes Added**:
```ruby
# Election model
scope :recent, -> { order(election_date: :desc) }
scope :with_full_details, -> { includes(:office, :candidates, :candidacies) }
scope :with_candidacy_details, -> { includes(candidacies: [:person, :ratings]) }
scope :with_office_context, -> { includes(office: :position) }

# Office model  
scope :active, -> { where(is_active: true) }
scope :with_elections_and_candidates, -> { includes(:position, elections: :candidates) }

# Voter model
scope :with_voting_activity, -> { includes(:ratings, :voter_election_baselines, ...) }

# Person model
scope :with_candidacy_details, -> { includes(candidacies: [election: [office: :position]]) }
scope :with_recent_candidacies, -> { includes(...).joins(...).order('elections.election_date DESC') }

# Geographic models
scope :in_country, :in_state, :with_election_data, :with_office_data
# Helper methods: active_elections_count, total_offices_count

# Rating/Candidacy models
scope :for_voter_in_election, :with_election_context, :with_rating_details
```

**Controllers Updated**: ElectionsController, OfficesController, VotersController, PeopleController, StatesController, CitiesController, MountainsController

**Benefits Achieved**:
- Eliminated N+1 queries through efficient eager loading
- Centralized complex query logic into reusable scopes  
- Improved code readability with semantic scope names
- Enhanced maintainability across the application

### 2. Phlex Method Name Refactoring

**Problem**: View methods prefixed with `render_` violated project naming conventions and weren't reusable.

**Refactoring Applied**:
- **Removed `render_` prefixes**: `render_expandable_candidates` → `expandable_candidates`
- **Made methods public**: Removed `private` keyword for reusability
- **Added default parameters**: `expandable_candidates(election = @election)` for flexibility
- **Removed `respond_to?` checks**: Followed project convention to trust objects

**Files Updated**:
- `app/views/elections/election_partial.rb`
- `app/views/offices/office_partial.rb`  
- `app/views/people/person_partial.rb`
- `app/views/voters/voter_partial.rb`
- `app/views/components/hierarchical_navigation.rb`

**Key Pattern Established**:
```ruby
# Before
private
def render_current_office_holder
  current_winner = @office.current_office_holder
  # markup
end

# After  
def current_office_holder(office = @office)
  current_winner = office.current_office_holder
  # markup
end
```

### 3. Rails 8 + Turbo Syntax Updates

**Issue**: Deprecated `method: :post` syntax for `link_to` needed updating for Rails 8 compatibility.

**Updates Made**:
- `link_to` with HTTP methods: `method: :post` → `data: { turbo_method: :post }`
- `button_to` remains unchanged (still uses `method: :post`)
- Fixed redundant method declarations in DeviseLinks

### 4. Single-Use Variable Analysis & Refactoring

**Analysis Report Generated**: Identified 7 single-use variables across 3 classes requiring refactoring.

**Specific Refactoring**:
- **HierarchicalNavigation**: Inlined boolean expressions, renamed methods
- **YAxisLabels**: Extracted position calculation into methods
- **Followed project conventions**: "Call methods directly on results rather than storing in variables for single use"

### 5. Architecture Documentation Enhancement

**Added Governance & Policy Models** to `/doc/llm-assistant/project-context/architecture.md`:

**8 New Models Specified**:
1. **GoverningBody** - Actual governing entities (City Council, Legislature)
2. **GovernanceType** - Types of governance structures  
3. **AreaOfConcern** - Policy domains (Public Safety, Education)
4. **Policy** - Join table: GoverningBody ↔ AreaOfConcern
5. **OfficialCode** - Legal codes and enforcement mechanisms
6. **Issue** - Abstract political topics (kept separate from policies)
7. **Stance** - Join table: Candidacy ↔ Issue  
8. **Town** - Additional jurisdiction type

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Issues remain abstract (not directly tied to policy implementations)
- Jurisdictional context flows through candidacy→election→office→jurisdiction
- Policy enforcement details captured for voter education
- Full CRUD scaffolds planned for all models

### 6. GovernanceType Implementation

**Generated Complete Scaffold**:
- Model with authority_level enum (local, regional, state, federal)
- Full Phlex view set (index, show, new, edit, form, partial)
- Controller with standard CRUD operations
- RSpec specs and FactoryBot factories
- Database migration and routing

**Seed Data Created**: 9 comprehensive governance types:
- Municipal Legislature, County Executive/Legislature
- State Executive/Legislature, Federal Executive/Legislature
- School Board, Special District Board

**Navigation Reorganized**: Grouped links into logical sections:
- **Jurisdictions**: Countries, States, Cities
- **Governance**: Positions, Governance Types, Offices
- **Elections**: Years, Elections, People, Candidacies  
- **Voting**: Voters, Residences, Ratings, Baselines, Mountains

**Browser Testing Completed**: Verified full functionality of GovernanceTypes CRUD interface.

## Technical Patterns Established

### 1. Scope Design Pattern
```ruby
# Reusable association loading
scope :with_[context]_details, -> { includes(...) }

# Conditional filtering with defaults
scope :in_[scope], ->(param) { where(scope: param) if param.present? }

# Ordering patterns
scope :recent, -> { order(created_at: :desc) }
```

### 2. Phlex Method Pattern  
```ruby
# Public, reusable methods with default parameters
def method_name(object = @instance_var)
  # Logic using passed object for flexibility
end
```

### 3. Rails 8 Link Pattern
```ruby
# Correct Turbo syntax
link_to "Text", path, data: { turbo_method: :method }

# Button_to unchanged
button_to "Text", path, method: :method
```

## Code Quality Improvements

### Test Coverage
- **All model specs passing**: 76 examples, 0 failures
- **All view specs passing**: 28 examples, 0 failures  
- **Controller specs passing**: Including mountains after refactoring
- **Hierarchical navigation specs**: Pre-existing issues unrelated to refactoring

### Performance Enhancements
- **Database query optimization**: Reduced N+1 queries through strategic eager loading
- **Database-level operations**: Moved sorting and filtering from Ruby to SQL
- **Efficient scope chaining**: Composable query patterns

### Code Organization
- **Centralized query logic**: Complex includes moved to reusable scopes
- **Improved naming**: Semantic scope and method names  
- **Enhanced reusability**: Public methods with flexible parameters
- **Documentation**: Updated architecture with new governance system

## Next Steps Identified

1. **Complete Governance System**: Generate remaining models (AreaOfConcern, GoverningBody, Policy, etc.)
2. **Address Duplication**: Elevate OfficialCode and Policy for cross-jurisdiction sharing
3. **Enhanced Seed Data**: Create realistic governance scenarios
4. **Integration Testing**: Verify governance system integration with existing election models
5. **CSS Organization**: Apply semantic styling to new governance components

## Key Learning & Conventions Reinforced

- **Ruby Style**: Trust objects, avoid premature nil checking, call methods directly on results
- **Phlex Patterns**: Public reusable methods, default parameters, semantic naming
- **Rails Best Practices**: Scope organization, eager loading strategies, modern Turbo syntax
- **Architecture**: Polymorphic associations, join table patterns, educational data design

This session significantly improved code quality, performance, and maintainability while laying the foundation for the governance system that will enhance voter education and accountability features.
