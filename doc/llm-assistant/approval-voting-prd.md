# Product Requirements Document: Approval Voting Platform

## 0. Project Name

### 0.1 Ascent

The term "ascent" is a reference to the visual metaphor that serve as the focal point of this system.  While Approval Voting is a familiar concept to some political scientists, and a similar form of voting known as Ranked Choice or Instant Runoff is becoming well-known in Democratic primaries, the system of rating candidates such that a baseline threshold determines vote allocation is novel.  This process results in the illustration of a "mountain" for each voter's approach to each race, so the term "ascent" is a reminder that this is the nexus of that opportunity to express a rich political opinion.  Ascent is also a word frequently used to describe the career of politicians, and one of the really notable possibilities that Approval Voting would seem to facilitate is the enhanced visibility for the popularity of the candidates who did not become the nominee.  By almost fully eliminating the spoiler effect, it should be possible for significantly similar candidates to share support, making each of them appear more successful than they would have under a traditional approach to voting.  By exposing this popularity, their role in the resulting political team could be enhanced.

Assent is a homophone of ascent, and it also factors into the frames being explored by this work.  To assent is defined as to agree to or approve of something (such as an idea or suggestion), especially after thoughtful consideration.  It is related to consent, but is simultaneously more and less formalized.  This project, in addition to developing a way to describe one's support for various candidates, will help voters describe why they have the preferences that they indicate, and will aim to accurately inform them on the topics and stances that can help them develop their choices.  This ought to feed back into the decisions made by candidates, who are expected, encouraged, and enabled to respond enthusiastically to the preferences of their supporters as well as their detractors.

## 1. Executive Summary

This platform aims to educate users about Approval Voting while providing tools for conducting mock elections, historical election simulations, and binding organizational votes. The system incorporates advanced features for studying polling dynamics, strategic voting behavior, and introduces a novel "mountain" rating system to help voters navigate large candidate fields effectively. Beyond policy positions, the platform emphasizes character assessment, personal aptitude, and comprehensive candidate evaluation to create more informed voters.

- Educates the public about Approval Voting methodology
- Enables practical implementation of approval-based elections
- Studies and mitigates strategic voting manipulation
