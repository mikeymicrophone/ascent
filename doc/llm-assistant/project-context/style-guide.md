 Now that the semantic structure is solid and functional, we should add visual polish:

    1. Color System Implementation
      - Define a semantic color palette in CSS variables
      - Add color coding for different entity types (elections, topics, candidates)
      - Implement status-based colors (active, completed, upcoming elections)
      - Add hover states and interactive feedback
    2. Shadow and Depth System
      - Add subtle shadows to cards and expandable sections
      - Create visual hierarchy with layered shadows
      - Implement depth changes on interaction (expandables, buttons)
    3. Enhanced Expandable Styling
      - Add smooth animations for expand/collapse
      - Style the ▶/▼ indicators with colors
      - Add subtle borders and background colors to expanded sections
    4. Interactive Polish
      - Hover effects on links and buttons
      - Focus states for accessibility
      - Smooth transitions between states

The application is now structurally excellent and semantically clean. Adding colors and 
shadows will make it not just functional and cute, but truly beautiful and engaging for 
users.

Remember to structure the CSS according to the 4-layer system, using tailwind @apply whenever possible.

**Important Note:**
3-D transforms are encouraged!

### Examples

#### Number 1: Sides of a box
- rotating a box horizontally engages the viewer as they scroll through a sequence of similar items

#### Number 2: Clockwise Twist
- this is an option for expanding/collapsing content, evocative of turning on a faucet

#### Number 3: Moved into foreground with parallax
- this is a technique for highlighting an item, such as the most popular of the options - or the one that the viewer has selected
