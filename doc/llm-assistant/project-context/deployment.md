# Railway deployments

## Staging

The `staging` branch is prepared for Railway project `ascent`, environment `staging`
(`4d3f6033-e84b-4c46-8981-255dd3d51325`), service `ascent-staging`
(`751fde16-4d76-446c-9dc2-8dbf92df7723`). The service has the domains
`https://begin.ascent.ing` and `https://ascent-staging-staging.up.railway.app`.

Set `RAILS_ENV=staging` to load `config/environments/staging.rb`. It inherits
production settings for HTTPS, eager loading, PostShiba, Solid Cache, and Solid
Queue. Account-email links use `https://begin.ascent.ing`. Set `APP_HOST` to change
that host. The `staging` entries in the database, cache, queue, and cable YAML
files configure the four database connections and Solid Cable.

Runtime variables must include `SECRET_KEY_BASE`, `DATABASE_URL`,
`CACHE_DATABASE_URL`, `QUEUE_DATABASE_URL`, and `CABLE_DATABASE_URL`. Keep the
staging databases and secret key separate from production. Use `postgis://` for
the database URLs. Set `PORT=80`, `HTTP_PORT=80`, and `SOLID_QUEUE_IN_PUMA=true`.
The upload volume is mounted at `/rails/storage`.

Doppler project `ascent`, config `stg`, has `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`,
`GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `POSTSHIBA_API_KEY`. Supply those keys through Railway
variables or a Doppler integration. The Rails environment file reads environment
variables and does not fetch secrets from Doppler. Register the staging origin
followed by `/voters/auth/google_oauth2/callback` with Google.

Use the root Dockerfile, `/up` as the health check, and
`./bin/rails db:prepare` as the pre-deploy command with a 3600-second timeout.
The Docker entrypoint also runs `db:prepare` before the default server command.
Changing the Rails environment file does not change Railway variables or enable
GitHub auto-deploy.

### Automatic staging deployments

Railway's native GitHub auto-deploy builds pushes to `staging`. The root Dockerfile
fetches both public submodule repositories over HTTPS using full commit hashes.
The build excludes local submodule directories and copies the fetched contents into
the application before precompilation. No submodule credentials or GitHub Actions
deployment token are required.

When changing a submodule's recorded commit, update the matching `ADD` source in
`Dockerfile`. When adding a submodule, add its pinned `ADD` source and exclude its
local directory in `.dockerignore`. `.github/workflows/submodule-pins.yml` checks
that every declared submodule matches its Docker source on pull requests and pushes
to `main` or `staging`. The same Dockerfile behavior applies to production builds;
this setup does not deploy production.

## Production

Project `ascent`: `960d98ac-f430-4165-9f9e-28d00f2b9b6d`.
Production environment: `259bfed3-8ac2-4f04-a90b-26f00942cbca`.
App service `ascent-production`: `7fe0c497-152a-4143-bec6-238ef030ca3d`.
Database service `Postgres-3s-_`: `323955e2-00b7-4dcc-9105-bd1b8150abad`.

The app uses the root Dockerfile and listens on port 80 with `PORT=80` and `HTTP_PORT=80`.
The health check is `/up`. Database preparation runs through `./bin/rails db:prepare`
before deployment, with a 3600-second timeout. Initial preparation loads the reference
seeds; subsequent releases migrate the existing databases. Never run the simulated
seed task in production.

`DATABASE_URL` must use the `postgis://` scheme so Rails selects the spatial adapter.
`CACHE_DATABASE_URL`, `QUEUE_DATABASE_URL`, and `CABLE_DATABASE_URL` use separate
databases on the same PostgreSQL service. `RAILS_ENV=production` and
`SOLID_QUEUE_IN_PUMA=true` enable the production configuration and background jobs.
The app's persistent upload volume is mounted at `/rails/storage`.

The PostgreSQL service uses the image built from `docker/postgres/Dockerfile`.
It extends Railway's PostgreSQL 18 image with PostGIS while retaining the `pgaudit`
module required by the existing database configuration. Its persistent data volume
is mounted at `/var/lib/postgresql/data`, with `PGDATA` set to its `pgdata` subdirectory.
Do not replace this build with the unmodified PostgreSQL image, which lacks PostGIS,
or the staging image, which lacks the required audit module.

Deploy the app from the repository root, targeting the production IDs explicitly.
To rebuild the database image, deploy `docker/postgres` with `--path-as-root` and
target the database service. The app and database have different Dockerfiles.
Verify the submitted deployment ID reaches `SUCCESS`, the app's `/up` and public
pages respond successfully, and the database can execute `SELECT postgis_full_version()`.

Runtime secrets belong in Railway variables. Generate a distinct `SECRET_KEY_BASE`
for production. `POSTSHIBA_API_KEY` comes from Doppler project `ascent`, config `prd`.
Mail links target `https://ascent.ing`; delivered email and those links require
verification after DNS setup.

The temporary public origin is `https://ascent-production-production.up.railway.app`.
Google sign-in requires `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` at app boot.
Register the chosen origin followed by `/voters/auth/google_oauth2/callback` with Google.
Umami reads `UMAMI_SCRIPT_URL` and `UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID`; without the website ID, the
tracker is omitted. Custom DNS, Google credentials, and Umami setup are separate
follow-up steps after the initial production release.

## Initial release verification

The October 31, 2026 app deployment `743ffab3-8ae9-4c77-8308-1ac96da9cd95`
reached `SUCCESS`. Database deployment `6498b65c-d5e5-49e4-96dd-3f49d9e18931`
also succeeded, providing PostGIS 3.7.0 and retaining the audit module.

The release used a working-tree snapshot based on app commit `141899f` and seed
commit `a4e4c5f979dd41fbb54c4a9de2124f85d6fd9ced`. Its file checksum manifest is
retained locally at `/private/tmp/ascent-production-20261031-manifest.json`.
While the deployment ran, the checkout moved to `main` at `6d5a9e3`; the changed
runtime source files differed from the deployed snapshot only in comments.

All 418 manifests validated, covering 141,861 source records. Initial reference
seeding created 141,259 records, reported 602 unchanged records and zero conflicts,
and gathered 4,438 candidacies from primaries. The completed database contained
141,311 entity codes, 22,291 people, 17,202 races, and 35,136 candidacies, with no
fictional people. Initial database preparation took about 17 minutes.

`/up`, `/`, `/voters/sign_in`, `/mountains`, `/positions`, and the compiled homepage
stylesheet returned HTTP 200. The queue supervisor, dispatcher, and worker had live
heartbeats. Cache and upload storage passed reversible write/read checks. The
focused local suite passed 65 examples with zero failures. Google and Umami remained
unconfigured; delivered email was not tested.

That release exposed a performance issue in `/mountains`: the response was
17,230,691 bytes, and Rails reported about 5.9 seconds and 17,934 queries, including
cached queries. At the time, `MountainsController#index` loaded every active race.
The current `staging` branch ranks races in SQL, paginates 25 races per page,
and shares the national-prominence lookup between ranking and display.
