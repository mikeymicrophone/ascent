# Tools Used in Development Sessions

This file tracks the tools and functions called during development sessions to help configure auto-approval settings.

## Session: 2025-06-18 Foundation Models & Generator Enhancement

### Tools Called (in chronological order):

```json
{
  "Task": "Task",
  "Bash": "Bash", 
  "Glob": "Glob",
  "Read": "Read",
  "LS": "LS",
  "exit_plan_mode": "exit_plan_mode",
  "Write": "Write",
  "Edit": "Edit"
}
```

### Tool Usage Summary:

- **Task** - Used for searching code conventions and researching codebase structure
- **Bash** - Used for checking available Rake tasks and examining bin directory
- **Glob** - Used for finding files by pattern (cursor rules, generator templates)
- **Read** - Used extensively for reading existing files (README, Gemfile, config files, documentation, generator templates)
- **LS** - Used for exploring directory structures throughout the codebase
- **exit_plan_mode** - Used twice to present implementation plans to user for approval
- **Write** - Used for creating new files (CLAUDE.md, architecture.md, session recap)
- **Edit** - Used for modifying existing files (updating architecture.md with generator info)

### Most Frequently Used:
1. **Read** (11 calls) - Reading configuration, documentation, and template files
2. **LS** (5 calls) - Exploring directory structures
3. **Bash** (4 calls) - Checking system state and available commands
4. **Glob** (4 calls) - Finding files by patterns
5. **Write** (3 calls) - Creating documentation files
6. **Task** (2 calls) - Researching codebase conventions
7. **Edit** (1 call) - Updating documentation
8. **exit_plan_mode** (2 calls) - Presenting plans for approval

### Notes:
- Most tools were used for research and documentation creation
- No modification tools were used on code files (only documentation)
- Plan mode was respected throughout - no premature code changes made
